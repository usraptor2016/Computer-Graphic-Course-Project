<p>So far, this workbook has mainly been me writing code (and html),
and you reading it. Hopefully, you also took the opportunity to
do some extra reading (for example, reading some JavaScript references).
And some tinkering (one way to understand my programs is to try to
make changes to see how things work).</p>
<p>To help you check that you are getting the concepts, here are a few
little programming things to try. In each "box" I will ask you to do
something. You should edit the "four.html" and "four.js" files
accordingly to do it. These will be the things that the grader will check.</p>
<p>These little exercises are simple - and not very interesting.
But make sure you understand what you are doing, since they will
be the building blocks for doing more interesting things later.</p>
<p>And don't forget to edit the <code>README.md</code> file 
(if we don't know your WiscID and GitHub ID, we can't give you credit),
and the <code>QUESTIONS.md</code> file. </p>
<p>And of course, to correctly use GIT to commit your work and push it
back to the repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Note that for grading, you will get full points if you get at least
a partially right program for each exercise.</p>

    <div id='box01' class="examplebox">
        <H2>Exercise 1: Sliders</H2>
        <p>
            In this box, make 3 sliders. Add event handlers such that the third
            slider shows the difference in value between the first two.
            So that slider3 = slider2 - slider1. Slider3 should move whenever
            slider1 or slider2 are moved. Making it such that slider1 and/or slider2 move
            when slider3 moves is a little trickier (and optional).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> Box 4 on page three is a good starting point.
            The lower of the two sliders there has a nicer behavior for this exercise.
            Consider setting the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
            properties of the sliders so that the third slider has the right range.
            The <code>min</code> can be negative.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="box02" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Exercise 2: Start Stop</H2>
        <p>
            In this box, make a slider and two buttons. One labeled "start" the other labeled "stop".
            When you press "start", the slider starts moving. When you press "stop" the slider stops.
            This is sortof like the last slider in Box 6 on page three, except that you should
            use two buttons, rather than one checkbox.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> With buttons, the easier thing is to handle the
            <code>onclick</code> events. The event handlers will need to pass information
            to the animation loop. You'll have to store the state information somewhere.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="box03" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Exercise 3: Throb, not blink</H2>
        <p>
            The "blinking" in Box 7 of page three is really annoying. Instead let's make
            something a little less annoying: instead of just changing to another color
            in a flash, have the color slowly (but not too slowly) change from white to red,
            then back to white. (it should repeat). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> A trick here is that HTML like colors as hex (so red is #FF0000).
            You'll probably want to do your math with regular numbers and convert.
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString">here</a>
            is a reference page that might be useful. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to try something more challenging, have it fade gradually between a list
            of colors (just like page 3 switched between red, yellow, and green, you could make
            yours slowly fade from red to yellow to green then back to red).
